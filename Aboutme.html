    <h1>Who is <strong>Eddie Onchieku?</strong></h1>
    <img src="css/images/eddie.jpg" alt="eddies image">
    <p>Eddie onchieku is a young man who just joined Moringa school for prep and would want to finish till core.
     I can personaly admit that the first week so far wasn't as easy as i expected and personally 
    would admit to the thought of giving up from time to time.
    What i would like to get from Moringa is quite simple, awesomeness in the tech world.
    in an african aspect</p>
    <p>In my opinion our heritage is built in grounds that do not support our growth and
        and development of our own. We are too stereotpic and we do not want to walk the talk
        therefore I would like to be that change and Moringa is like part of that african success.
    </p>
    <h2>Eddie's past;</h2>
      <P>Eddie Onchieku is a fresher in the industry. Just completed his O-levels therefore 
          no work experience whatsoever just ideas to what an experience consists of.
